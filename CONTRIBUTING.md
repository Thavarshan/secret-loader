### Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests from the community. If you would like to submit a pull request, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork locally.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/envsecrets.git
   cd envsecrets
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear and descriptive messages.

   ```bash

   ```

4. **Push your changes** to your fork.

5. **Submit a pull request** on the original repository, providing a clear description of the changes and the problem or feature they address.

### Writing Tests

Please ensure that any new features or bug fixes are accompanied by relevant unit tests. We use [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for testing. You can run the test suite using:

```bash
bats test_secrets.bats
```

Make sure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

### Code Style

- Follow best practices for writing clean, readable Bash scripts.
- Keep your commits focused. Each commit should represent a single change.
- Avoid large "monolithic" commits with multiple unrelated changes.
